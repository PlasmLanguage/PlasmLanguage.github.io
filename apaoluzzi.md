## Professor Alberto Paoluzzi

Alberto Paoluzzi is a distinguished figure in the field of computer science, currently serving as a Professor of Computer Science at the University "Roma Tre" within the Department of Mathematics and Physics, a position he has held since 2000. His academic journey includes a significant tenure with the Department of Computer Science and Automation at Roma Tre from its foundation in 1993. Prior to this, he was an associate professor of Computer Graphics at the University "La Sapienza" of Rome, starting in 1983.

At present, Professor Paoluzzi imparts his extensive knowledge by lecturing on Computational Graphics and Biomedical Engineering in the School of Engineering at Roma Tre. He is also the head of the Geometric Computing Lab at the university, a center for the development of advanced geometric languages and various prototype tools. His contributions to the field were recognized in 2003 with a Shared University Research (SUR) award from IBM, which included the donation of complete equipment for a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Lab.

Professor Paoluzzi is a prolific author, most notably of the book "Geometric Programming for Computer Aided Design," published by Wiley in 2003. This work is central to understanding the PLaSM (Programming LAnguage for Solid Modeling) language, a design language he was instrumental in developing. PLaSM is recognized for blending a powerful algebraic approach to programming with a dimension-independent approach to geometric data structures and algorithms. In addition to this key text, he has authored two other books and approximately 100 papers published in international journals and conference proceedings. His work has also received accolades, including a best paper award at CAD06.

He is an active member of several prestigious professional organizations, including ACM Siggraph, the Computer Society of the IEEE, and the Society for Complex Systems. Furthermore, Professor Paoluzzi serves as an associated editor for the "Computer-Aided Design and Applications" journal, contributing to the dissemination of cutting-edge research in the field.

His international experience includes a sabbatical in 1986 at Cornell University, supported by a grant from the Mathematical Science Institute, and he has been awarded various TJO fellowships at the Institute for Computational Engineering and Science of the University of Texas at Austin. He actively collaborates on numerous international research projects. His recent research interests are focused on physically-based object representations utilizing algebraic topology methods, continuing his pursuit of innovation in geometric computing and its applications.

### Contributions to PLaSM

Professor Paoluzzi's work is intrinsically linked with the development and philosophy of the PLaSM language. PLaSM, the Programming LAnguage for Solid Modeling, was developed by the CAD Group at the Universities of Roma La Sapienza and Roma Tre. It is a design language that emphasizes a geometry-oriented extension of functional programming principles, allowing for the creation of compact and efficient geometric code. His book, "Geometric Programming for Computer Aided Design," extensively details the PLaSM language and its application in computing with geometry, often producing VRML output.
